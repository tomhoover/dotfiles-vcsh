" If you are asking how to configure whether you use hard tabs (tab characters) vs. 
" spaces for indentation, based on filetype, you can do that using autocmd hooks.
"
" For example, here is my base indent configuration for most files. It sets a tabstop 
" of 8 (for hard tab display), and most tabs / indentation shifts are 4, and they use spaces, not hard tabs.
"set tabstop=8 softtabstop=4 shiftwidth=4 expandtab
set tabstop=8 shiftwidth=4 expandtab
"
" However, in some syntaxes that is wrong. For instance, I want 2 spaces in Javascript and YAML. 
" And in Makefiles, space indent is a syntax error - there, I want hard tabs. You can set these things 
" using autocmd and the filetype in question.
