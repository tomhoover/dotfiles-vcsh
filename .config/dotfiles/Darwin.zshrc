# To activate these completions, add the following to your .zshrc:
#
#   if type brew &>/dev/null; then
#     FPATH=$(brew --prefix)/share/zsh-completions:$FPATH
#
#     autoload -Uz compinit
#     compinit

# You may also need to force rebuild `zcompdump`:
#
#   rm -f ~/.zcompdump; compinit
#
# Additionally, if you receive "zsh compinit: insecure directories" warnings when attempting
# to load these completions, you may need to run these commands:
#
#   chmod go-w '/opt/homebrew/share'
#   chmod -R go-w '/opt/homebrew/share/zsh'
